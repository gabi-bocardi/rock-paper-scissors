This is a JavaScript code of a ROCK PAPER SCISSORS game played by the user, and the computer. To begin, the code can be played though the browser console; Soon, I will work on some UI for this page. 
An brief explanation of the game, as said above it's a game between user and the computer. There are a few features in my version: it is a  5 rounds games; The winner is announced after the points are compared or if the result is a tie; In every round, the user is prompt to make a move, the result of the round and "rounds left" are displayed. 
I expect to enjoy the process of solving this game, and have fun at coding it! So I wish myself some good luck.
Ps: I did enjoy the challenge!

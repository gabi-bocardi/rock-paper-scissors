This is a JavaScript code of a ROCK PAPER SCISSORS game played by the user, and the computer. To begin, the code can be played though the browser console; Soon, I will work on some UI for this page. 
I expect to enjoy the process of solving this game, and have fun at coding it! So I wish myself some good luck.
